            <li>1 large egg, beaten, or more to taste</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. Place
            <br>shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring well to remove as much moisture as possible.</li>

            <li>Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl; save any extra for another 
            <br>use. Add egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined.</li>

            <li>Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place large spoonfuls of 
            <br>potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. 
            <br>Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side</li>
            <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot.</li>
